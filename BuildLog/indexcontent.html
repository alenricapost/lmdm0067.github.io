		<H3>Introduction</H3>
		<p>This page will give instructions on how to build the Prototype lab flow. 
		This project was built and designed by Kenneth Mendoza, Sukhdeep Seehera and Myself (Matheus Almeida). 
		By replicating our instructions, user should be able to replicate our end result as well..</p>

		<H3>Budget</H3>
		<p>Our project is fairly simple on the hardware side, but the user is required to have access to a network and to have an HDMI display, 
		a mouse and a keyboard to set up and use the raspberry PI.</p>

		<H3>Time Commitment</H3>
		<p>Our project was completed throughout our 5th semester and took us some time to figure out how to scan the items properly and efficiently. 
		That being said, it is not a lengthy project on our hardware side since the camera has no conflicts with the PI nor does the PCB. It will take more time coding.

		<p>Once you acquired the raspberry pi 3, you will have to set it up.</p>

		<p>
		<li>Sudo apt-get install zbar- tools (This is needed to scan a QR code)</li>
		<li>Sudo apt-get update (Run this command if above command didn’t install properly)</li>
		<li>ls /dev/video* (This command check which video input is your webcam is connected to)</li>
		<li>zbarcam /dev/video* (The * needs to be change to the video input of your webcam is connected to.) </li>

		<H3>PCB Soldering</H3>
		<p>The modular sensor hat was provided by humber. We had to modify by adding our names to it and once it was done, we sent it to the prototype lab where it was printed. 
		Soldering was somewhat simple even though I didn’t have any previous experience with soldering. Took me about 3 hours to solder everything and around 30 minutes to test it.

		<H3>Power Up</H3>
		<p>Once you follow the steps above you can now power up the project. After the raspberry pi is turned on, go to terminal
			and run the command ./scanner.sh I will be providing a download link below for all the codes used for this project. 
			Once you run the code, zbarcam will pop out in a new window where you can see the webcam input and you can start 
			scanning QR codes. When a QR code gets scanned the LED from PCB will blink and the data from QR code will be saved 
			in a file called “scan-reults.txt”.</p>

		<H3>Unit Testing</H3>
		<p>First checked if the webcam is compatible by installing FSWEBCAM. Type: sudo apt-get install fswebcam on the pi’s terminal to install it. 
		Once completed run the program by typing: fswebcam image.jpg. If the camera is compatible it should open and take a picture. Secondly check if the LEDs on the PCB are working properly by running the file test.py. 
		If it works the led should blink in the color red. </p>

		<H3>Product Testing</H3>
		<p>After powering up run the shell script ./scanner.sh which is going to run test.py and exit.sh. It is then going to open the zbar library where you will scan your QR code. Once scanned it will create a .txt file with the QR info. 
		Every time you want to scan a QR you have to re run the program since it is easy for our testing purposes at the moment. 
		Test with multiple QRs to test its capabilities.</p>
